# CetaceanWhistleDetector

**Deep Learning for Cetacean Whistle Detection, case study in the Strait of Gibraltar**

Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is essential for monitoring marine ecosystems, but the high volume and complexity of underwater recordings make manual annotation unfeasible. This repository supports the development of a deep learning pipeline for cetacean whistle detection in the Strait of Gibraltar—a region with high biodiversity and intense anthropogenic noise.

The CetaceanWhistleDetector integrates BirdNET embeddings and a custom neural network classifier. A semi-supervised iterative annotation workflow, combined with confidence calibration, enables robust whistle detection in our real-world, noisy marine environment, the Strait of Gibraltar.

We also tested the integration of transfer learning with embeddings of bioacoustic pretrained models, specifically BirdNET and Perch, a custom binary classifier, iterative human validation, and confidence score threshold calibration to maximize performance under real-world deployment conditions.

## Highlights

- A semi-supervised pipeline combining BirdNET embeddings and a custom neural classifier.
- An F1-score of 0.88 on a noisy independent dataset (SEANIMALMOVE-WOPAM).
- Three real-world deployments validate model performance across acoustic conditions.
- A curated, annotated marine soundscape dataset was created with minimal manual effort.

## Data

The dataset includes over 1,300 hours of underwater acoustic recordings collected in the Strait of Gibraltar using the Sylence passive acoustic monitoring system. The recordings span multiple deployments across seasons and locations, providing diverse acoustic contexts essential for model generalization.

| Deployment   | Period                  | Total Hours | Seasonal Context            |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Deployment 1 | May 27 – June 13, 2024  | 367.3       | Mid-season (Moderate noise) |
| Deployment 2 | June 16 – July 15, 2024 | 686.7       | Peak season (High noise)    |
| Deployment 3 | Feb 21 – March 3, 2025  | 264.9       | Low season (Reduced noise)  |
| **Total**    |                         | **1,318.9** |                             |

An iterative training pipeline was used to build a domain-adapted dataset. Starting with pre-existing labeled data, the model was applied to unlabeled field data to identify potential whistles. These predictions were then manually reviewed using a custom web interface, and the validated detections were added to the training set for subsequent model refinement.

## Models

The final model is a custom neural network trained on BirdNET embeddings, selected after comparing multiple classification strategies using features from both BirdNET and Perch.

### Iterative Training Pipeline

The model was developed using a **semi-supervised iterative training strategy**:

1. **v0 - Initial Model**: Trained on the Watkins Marine Mammals dataset.
2. **v1 - Iteration 1**: Validated 3 days of predictions (WOPAM subset), added to training.
3. **v2 - Iteration 2**: Validated 3 more days, added to training, reserved WOPAM as an independent test set.
4. **Final Model**: Trained with all validated subsets.

This method enabled efficient annotation and domain adaptation, improving performance on local soundscapes with minimal manual effort.

## Results

The final BirdNET-based custom neural network classifier achieved perfect classification on the test set and maintained an F1-score of 0.88 on the independent SEANIMALMOVE-WOPAM dataset—outperforming all other models, especially under real-world noise conditions.

### Test and Noisy Dataset Performance

| Base Model | Classifier        | F1-Score (Test) | F1-Score (WOPAM) | F1 (Whistle) |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| BirdNET    | Random Forest     | 0.99            | 0.35             | 0.05         |
| BirdNET    | Custom Neural Net | **1.00**        | **0.88**         | **0.77**     |
| Perch      | SVC-RBF           | 1.00            | 0.52             | 0.10         |
| Perch      | XGBoost           | 0.95            | 0.44             | 0.04         |

### Field Deployment Performance (Treshold = 0.84)

| Deployment   | Accuracy | F1-Whistle | Recall-Whistle |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Deployment 1 | 0.84     | 0.84       | 0.77           |
| Deployment 2 | 0.76     | 0.76       | 0.75           |
| Deployment 3 | 0.73     | 0.73       | 0.53           |

Performance decreased under novel acoustic conditions in Deployment 3, reinforcing the importance of including diverse seasonal and spatial data during training.
